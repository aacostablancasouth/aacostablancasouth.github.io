          <br>“Alcoholics Anonymous is a fellowship of men and women who share their experience, strength and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism. The only requirement for AA membership is a desire to stop drinking.&nbsp;There are no dues or fees for AA membership; we are self supporting through our own contributions.&nbsp;AA is not&nbsp;allied&nbsp;with any sect, denomination, politics, organization or institution; does not wish to engage in any&nbsp;controversy, neither endorses nor opposes any causes.&nbsp;Our primary purpose is to stay sober and help other alcoholics to achieve&nbsp;sobriety.”&nbsp;<br>The A.A.

        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-6"> If you think you have a problem with drinking, we’re here to help. ​If you seem to be having trouble with your drinking, or if your drinking has reached the point where it worries you, you may be interested to know something about Alcoholics Anonymous and the AA programme of recovery from alcoholism.​ After reading this brief outline you may, indeed, decide that AA has nothing to offer you.&nbsp;Should this be the case, we suggest only that you keep an open mind on the subject. Consider your drinking carefully in the light of what you learn from this website.​ Determine for yourself whether or not alcohol has truly become a problem for you. And remember that you will always be most welcome to join the thousands of men and women in AA who have put their drinking problems behind them and now lead “normal” lives of constructive, day by day sobriety. ​If you have already decided that you do want help please see Get Help Now section on the right of this page. Remember there are no dues or fees for AA, we are self-supporting by our own contributions. ​We who are in A.A. came because we finally gave up trying to control our drinking. We still hated to admit that we could never drink safely. Then we heard from other A.A. members that we were sick. We found out that many people suffered from the same feelings of guilt, loneliness and hopelessness that we did. We found out that we had these feelings because we were sick with alcoholism. ​We decided to try to face up to what alcohol had done to us. Here are some of the questions we tried to answer honestly. See how you do. Remember, there is no disgrace in facing up to the fact that you have a problem.</p>
